# Expense Tracking API

A personal finance management REST API built with Spring Boot. Tracks income and expenses — both manually and automatically via Open Banking (GoCardless). Originally designed for Vietnam's Casso webhook, migrated to GoCardless Bank Account Data API for EU/UK coverage.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
> *Database design, project setup, and authentication system*

- **Database (PostgreSQL 16):** Tables for `users`, `transactions`, `categories`, `bank_configs`, `sync_logs`
- **Schema Management:** Flyway migrations (3 migration files), JPA set to `validate` only
- **Authentication:** Register/Login with JWT (HS256, 24h expiry), BCrypt password hashing
- **Security:** Per-user data isolation — User A cannot access User B's data
- **User Profile:** View profile, update name, change password

### Phase 2: Business Logic & Manual Features
> *Core expense tracking features that work without bank integration*

- **Transaction CRUD:** Create, read, update, delete transactions with amount, type (IN/OUT), category, description, date
- **Categories:** Auto-created per-user when first used, typed as income (IN) or expense (OUT)
- **Dashboard:** Total income, total expense, calculated balance
- **CSV Export:** Download filtered transactions as spreadsheet
- **Filtering:** Paginated transaction list with category and date range filters
- **Bank/Cash Switching:** Transactions can be linked to a bank account or marked as cash

### Phase 3: Bank Integration (GoCardless)
> *Originally Casso webhook (Vietnam) → Migrated to GoCardless Open Banking (EU/UK)*

**Migration from Casso:** The original design used Casso's webhook to receive real-time bank notifications from Vietnamese banks. This was migrated to GoCardless Bank Account Data API (PSD2-compliant) for broader EU/UK bank coverage with a pull-based model.

- **Bank Browsing:** List available banks by country (Revolut, Barclays, HSBC, etc.)
- **Bank Linking:** OAuth-style flow — user authorizes on their bank's website
- **Initial Sync:** 90 days of transaction history imported on first link
- **Manual Sync:** On-demand transaction pull with custom date range
- **Background Scheduler:** Automatic sync every 15 minutes for active users
- **Sync History:** View past sync attempts, results, and errors
- **Unlink:** Disconnect bank while preserving all imported transactions
- **Deduplication:** Prevents duplicate transactions across overlapping syncs
- **Activity Tracking:** Skips syncing for users inactive >30 days
- **Expiry Detection:** Auto-detects expired bank access and marks accounts

### Phase 4: Frontend & Real-time
> *React SPA with Ant Design — core UI implemented, WebSocket pending*

**Done:**
- [x] React 19 + Vite 7 project setup with Ant Design 6
- [x] JWT authentication flow (login, register, auto-redirect)
- [x] Dashboard page: stat cards (income/expense/balance), spending pie chart, recent transactions
- [x] Transaction CRUD: filterable table, pagination, add/edit modal, CSV export
- [x] Category management: list, create, edit, delete with emoji icons
- [x] Bank Accounts: link flow, manual sync, sync history, unlink
- [x] Profile page: edit name, change password
- [x] Responsive sidebar layout with navigation

**Pending:**
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket (STOMP) — live transaction feed without page refresh
- [ ] Mobile-responsive polish

See [Frontend Architecture](./FRONTEND.md) for full details.

### Phase 5: DevSecOps & Deploy
> *Production deployment infrastructure — PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED*

**Done:**
- [x] Docker Compose for PostgreSQL database

**Pending:**
- [ ] Dockerfile for the Spring Boot application
- [ ] Full `docker-compose.yml` with app + DB containers
- [ ] Deploy to VPS or cloud platform (Render/Railway)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS certificate configuration
